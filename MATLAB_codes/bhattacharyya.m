function [d]=bhattacharyya(X1,X2)
% BHATTACHARYYA  Bhattacharyya distance between two Gaussian classes
% d = bhattacharyya(X1,X2) returns the Bhattacharyya distance between X1 and X2.
% Inputs: X1 and X2 are n x m matrices represent two sets which have n
%         samples and m variables.
% Output: d is the Bhattacharyya distance between these two sets of data.
